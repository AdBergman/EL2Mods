# EL2 Mods

This repository contains a collection of small, focused mods for **Endless Legend 2**.

Each mod is designed to solve a specific problem or add a narrowly scoped quality-of-life feature, with an emphasis on stability, transparency, and respect for the game’s core systems.

Mods are developed using **BepInEx** and **Harmony**, and target single-player gameplay unless explicitly stated otherwise.
